    "question": "A small bird native to Australian forests, the wattlebird honeyeater, is on the verge of extinction. The situation is made more difficult by the fact that these birds have trouble forming pairs. To help them, ornithologists capture the males and keep them in cages for a certain period of time. During this time, scientists effectively become \"X\" for the birds.\nQuestion: Name X in two words.",
    "correct_answer": "Vocal Teacher",
    "verdict": {
      "winner": "Solver 1",
      "winning_answer": "Pair Bonding Coaches",
      "confidence": 0.65,
      "reasoning": "The prompt describes a scenario where males are kept in cages for a 'period of time' to help them form pairs. Logically, this isolation implies a process of preparation, training, or rehabilitation (teaching them how to court) rather than the simple administrative act of arranging introductions (which 'Marriage brokers' would imply). While the specific trivia fact involves the Regent Honeyeater losing its song and scientists acting as 'Singing Teachers' or 'Music Tutors', Solver 1 correctly deduced the underlying mechanism: the scientists are conditioning behavior and 'coaching' the birds to succeed in courtship. Solver 2's 'Marriage brokers' captures the goal (pairing) but fails to account for the method (isolation/captivity), and Solver 3's 'Match enhancers' is linguistically weak."

    "question": "In one humorous social ad, visitors come to the doctor at night. The father asks whether unvaccinated children are dangerous for his son. The point is that the visitors are X s. Name X s with a non-georgian word.",
    "correct_answer": "Vampire",
    "verdict": {
      "winner": "Solver 1",
      "winning_answer": "Zombies",
      "confidence": 0.1,
      "reasoning": "This is a case of 'groupthink' leading to an incorrect consensus. The correct answer to this known riddle is 'Vampires'. The logic relies on the premise that vampires drink blood, and the father is worried his son will consume 'tainted' blood from an unvaccinated child. The 'night' setting and the sophisticated dialogue with a doctor fit the vampire trope, not the zombie trope (who are mindless and eat flesh/brains). Solver 1 correctly identified 'Vampires' in Phase 1 but was persuaded to switch to 'Zombies' by Solver 2's misleading critique regarding the 'vaccination' link (ignoring the blood connection). I selected Solver 1 as the winner solely because they were the only agent to identify the correct concept initially, demonstrating superior knowledge retrieval, even though the final refined answer 'Zombies' is factually incorrect."

    "question": "In the miniature of Kyrie Gray, this woman shoots a video in the so-called \"unboxing\" genre, and it is followed by a stream of negative comments. Guess the name of this woman.",
    "correct_answer": "Pandora",
    "verdict": {
      "winner": "Solver 2",
      "winning_answer": "Pandora",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "This is a classic 'What? Where? When?' style question that relies on mapping a classical myth to a modern context. All solvers eventually arrived at the correct answer, but Solver 2 demonstrated the most robust reasoning throughout the process. Solver 2 correctly identified the grammatical structure of the prompt (recognizing 'Kyrie Gray' as the author attribution rather than the subject) and provided a strong meta-game argument in Phase 2 against the literal interpretation (noting that if the answer were simply 'Kyrie Gray', the puzzle elements of 'unboxing' and 'negative comments' would be superfluous). The connection is that Pandora's box is the original 'unboxing', and the evils released are parallel to the toxicity found in internet comment sections. Solver 2's breakdown was the most logically complete and demonstrated the best understanding of the specific quiz format."

    "question": "After a trip to the south of France, a Soviet tourist, while describing the visitors of the X, mentions laboratory workers who were waiting in amazement for the results of the experiment. Name the X with a word of Italian origin.",
    "correct_answer": "Casino",
    "verdict": {
      "winner": "Solver 1",
      "winning_answer": "Casino",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "All solvers arrived at the correct answer, 'Casino'. The question is based on a quote by the Soviet writers Ilf and Petrov from their travelogue 'One-story America' (though the specific quote about the casino in Monte Carlo appears in their travel notes regarding the trip to Europe/France). They described the players around the roulette table as 'laboratory workers waiting in amazement for the results of the experiment'. 'Casino' is a word of Italian origin (diminutive of 'casa', meaning house). Solver 1 provided the correct answer in Phase 1 and maintained a strong, logical explanation throughout. Solver 2 initially faltered with 'Palazzo' but corrected course. Solver 3 initially guessed 'Villa' based on a literal interpretation but also corrected course. Solver 1 is chosen as the winner for getting it right immediately with sound reasoning that required no major correction, demonstrating better initial intuition for the metaphorical nature of the question/quote reliability context involved in 'What? Where? When?' games. Solver 1's explanation of the metaphor (uncertainty of outcomes) was precise and accurate from the start."

    "question": "A 1960s article that was published in the \"Chicago Tribune\", it is recommended to do this in the morning so as not to scare passersby and not to arouse the suspicion of the police. What do we changed by \"do this\"?",
    "correct_answer": [
      "Running",
      "Cardio"
    ],
    "verdict": {
      "winner": "Solver 1",
      "winning_answer": "Taking out the trash",
      "confidence": 0.2,
      "reasoning": "This is a difficult judgment because all three solvers provided incorrect final answers. The correct answer to this specific trivia question (based on a real 1968 Chicago Tribune article) is **Jogging** (or Running). In the 1960s, recreational running was rare, and night runners were often mistaken for burglars fleeing a crime scene, hence the advice to run in the morning to avoid police suspicion and scaring passersby. While Solver 1 ultimately selected 'Taking out the trash', they explicitly listed 'jogging' as a primary hypothesis in their Phase 3 explanation ('Consider activities... such as taking out the trash or jogging'), correctly identifying the underlying logic regarding temporal context and suspicion. Because Solver 1 was the only agent to identify the actual correct answer in their reasoning trace (even though they discarded it), they are the clear winner over Solver 2 ('Carry a gun') and Solver 3 ('Filming'), whose answers were implausible."

    "question": "At the opening ceremony of the 2018 Olympics, dancers depicted the X, which many took to be part of a Pepsi advertising campaign. Describe the X in several (max 5) words.",
    "correct_answer": "Flag of South Korea",
    "verdict": {
      "winner": "Solver 1",
      "winning_answer": "Red-blue taegeuk circle",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The question refers to a specific viral moment from the 2018 PyeongChang Opening Ceremony where performers formed the 'Taegeuk' (the red and blue yin-yang symbol found on the South Korean flag). Due to the red-over-blue swirling design, it bears a striking resemblance to the Pepsi logo, leading to the joke described. Both Solver 1 and Solver 2 correctly identified the symbol in the final phase (shifting away from generic 'flag colors' or 'costumes'), but Solver 1 provided the most concise and natural phrasing within the word limit."

    "question": "In a modern film, a wealthy character looks at a filled cup of coffee to evaluate a hired worker. Name the profession of this worker.",

    "verdict": {
      "winner": "Solver 1",
      "winning_answer": "Driver",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "Solver 1 correctly identified the profession as 'Driver' (or Chauffeur) from the start. The scenario describes a classic trope (popularized by 'Initial D' with water, but adaptable to coffee in other media) where a passenger evaluates a driver's smoothness and control by observing whether a liquid in a cup spills or ripples. Solver 1's logic was consistent and culturally grounded regarding the 'smoothness test.' Solver 2 initially guessed 'Assassin' (interpreting it as a steady-hand test) but later converged to Chauffeur. Solver 3 initially guessed 'Butler'. Solver 1 demonstrates the best initial intuition and consistent reasoning."

    "question": "In 1967, a well-known company purchased a large plot of land in the state of Florida, where, along with other buildings, the X was later built. You can see the X in the logo of this company. Name the X with two words that start with the same two letters.",
    "correct_answer": "Cindarella Castle",
    "verdict": {
      "winner": "Solver 1",
      "winning_answer": "Cinderella Castle",
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "reasoning": "The prompt describes the historical land purchase by the Walt Disney Company in Florida around 1967 (leading to Walt Disney World) and asks for a building constructed there that appears in the company's logo. The Disney logo famously features a stylized castle, widely recognized as 'Cinderella Castle' (the centerpiece of the Florida park). While 'Cinderella Castle' does not satisfy a strict interpretation of 'start with the same two letters' (i.e., 'Ci' vs 'Ca'), it satisfies the constraint if interpreted as 'start with the same letter' (C and C), which is a common translation artifact or riddle phrasing (referring to the two initial letters being identical). Solver 1 correctly identified the entity and honestly acknowledged the constraint friction, whereas Solver 2 switched to 'Mickey Mouse' (which is not a building and failed the constraint 'Mi' vs 'Mo' despite claiming otherwise). Solver 1's evaluation was the most logically sound."
